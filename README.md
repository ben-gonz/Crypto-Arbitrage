# Triangular Arbitrage Paper Trader

As a final project for an Advanced Python Programming class, I developed a program in Python that fetches cryptocurrency market prices, creates a graph with exchange rates as edges, finds the highest factor (arbitrage opportunity), and executes trades using a paper trading Alpaca account along the forward and reverse arbitrage paths. The program saves the currency prices using timestamped CSVs and saves the trade results and account balance to JSON.

Reach out to me if you're interested in seeing the script!
